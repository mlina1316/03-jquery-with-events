#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Lina and Haley paired together. It took about 5 hours**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, linked our script files.
  2. Next, we used jQuery to add the author name as an additional data-attribute.
  3. Next, we refactored concatenation strings using template literals.
  4. Then, we hid all the articles and only showed the ones that match for author.
  5. Then, we did the same for the category filters. 
  6. Next, we added Tab functionality to our nav bar by building a selector string with the correct ID based on th element that was selected by the user. 
  7. Lastly, we added a .read-on link to reveal all hidden elements when clicked on.
